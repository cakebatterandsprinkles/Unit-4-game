### :octocat: How long could you survive if your world depended on your math knowledge? 

### How It Works:

:curly_loop: You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

:curly_loop: There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

:curly_loop: You win the game by matching your total score to selected number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the selected random number.

:curly_loop: The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

:curly_loop: Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal. 

:curly_loop: _Good luck!_
